1) Cells that arent mines are considered mines
    Possible causes:
    # there is a sentence that says [(x, y)] = 1, when it shouldnt -->
      something is wrong with sentence subsetting?
      something is wrong with sentence.mark_safe?
    
    - if its not a problem with sentence subsetting, it probably results from marking cells as safe/mines
2) Program slows down when making 25+ moves
    Possible causes:
    1) possibly alot of set() = 0 causing slowdown by being a subset of every sentence
       Once full sentences are emptied by mark_safe, mark_mine creating alot of set() = 0
       Solution: at the end of add_knowledge() loop over every sentence in self.knowledge and delete set() = 0
